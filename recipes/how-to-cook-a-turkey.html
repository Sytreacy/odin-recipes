						Learn how to cook a turkey with this simple recipe. The biggest myth in American cookery is that a juicy, perfectly cooked turkey is difficult for the novice cook to achieve. Even if this is your first time, don't play scared; this will work! There is nothing to fear but the fear of dry turkey itself. Be sure to buy a meat thermometer before Thanksgiving; it will be the essential tool in the kitchen that day.

						<ul>
							<li>1 medium onion, coarsely chopped</li>
							<li>1 stalk celery, coarsely chopped</li>
							<li>1 medium carrot, coarsely chopped</li>
							<li>1 (12 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets reserved</li>
							<li>2 tablespoons kosher salt</li>
							<li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
							<li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

						<ol>
							<li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
                            <li>Place onion, celery, and carrot in a large, shallow roasting pan.</li>
                            <li>Place turkey, breast-side up, on top of vegetables in the roasting pan. Pat outside and inside of turkey dry with paper towels.</li>
                            <li>Combine salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl. Season inside of turkey with about 1/3 of the salt mixture. Fold wing tips under bird.</li>
                            <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until edges turn golden, about 2 minutes. Add rosemary and sage; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
                            <li>Place rosemary and sage inside cavity of turkey; reserve melted butter. Tie turkey legs together with twine.</li>
                            <li>Brush melted butter over turkey. Season with the remaining salt mixture.</li>
                            <li>Bake turkey, uncovered, in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and juices run clear, about 3 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).</li>
                            <li>Remove turkey from the oven and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
