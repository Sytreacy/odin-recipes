              <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
              <li>½ cup diced shallots</li>
              <li>½ pound white button mushrooms, sliced</li>

              <li>1 cup white wine</li>
              <li>1 pound sea scallops</li>
              <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
              <li>1 egg yolk</li>
              <li>2 teaspoons minced fresh tarragon</li>
              <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
              <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
              <li>4 large oven-safe scallop shells</li>
              <li>¼ cup shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
              <li>1 pinch paprika</li>
              <li>8 fresh tarragon leaves</li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
          <dt>Steps</dt>
          <dd>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add shallots
                and sauté until translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in mushrooms,
                salt, and black pepper; increase heat to medium-high and cook,
                stirring often, until mushrooms are golden brown, about 10
                minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pour wine into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the
                browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden
                spoon; bring to a simmer. Gently place scallops into wine and
                poach in the mushroom mixture until barely firm, about 2 minutes
                per side; transfer scallops to a bowl. Strain mushroom mixture
                into another bowl, reserving mushrooms and cooking liquid
                separately.
              </li>
              <li>
                Return strained liquid to skillet, pour in any accumulated juices from scallops, and stir in cream. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring often, until cream sauce is reduced by about half, about 10 minutes. Turn off heat and let mixture cool for 1 minute.
              </li>
              <li>
                Quickly whisk egg yolk into cream sauce until combined. Transfer skillet to a work surface (such as a heatproof countertop or cutting board) and stir 2 in teaspoons tarragon, lemon zest, and cayenne pepper.
              </li>
              <li>
                Divide mushroom mixture into scallop shells, spreading it out to cover the bottoms of shells; place about 3 scallops onto each portion. Spoon cream sauce over scallops to coat; let sauce drizzle down into mushrooms. Sprinkle lightly with Gruyère cheese and paprika.
              </li>
              <li>
                Preheat the oven's broiler. Slightly crinkle a large sheet of aluminum foil and place onto a baking sheet. Place filled shells onto foil and press lightly to help them stay level.
              </li>
              <li>
                Broil in the preheated oven until bubbling and cheese is lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Transfer to serving plates lined with napkins to prevent shells from tipping; garnish each portion with 2 crossed tarragon leaves.
